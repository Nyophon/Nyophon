- Hi, I’m @Nyophon (pronounced like nigh-oh-fawn)
- I’m currently learning game development with Unity and C#.
- You can find my game projects at https://nyophon.itch.io/
- I don't have much to show right now, but I'm currently working on a larger project and will release a demo of it as soon as it's ready.
